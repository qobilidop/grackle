== Version 2.1 ==
_Release date - Jun 3, 2015_

  * New feature: Added cooling_cell.py script to simulate the cooling of a
	single cell over time.
  * Enhancement: k19 reaction added to H- calculation.
  * Enhancement: Build system converted to using libtool.
  * Enhancement: Updated value of solar metal mass fraction to be
	consistent with Cloudy.
  * Enhancement: Mean molecular weight calculation in tabulated mode now
	correctly accounts for photo-ionization from UV backgrounds.
  * Bugfix: Metal field only considered in temperature calculation in
	tabulated mode if actually present.

== Version 2.0.1 ==
_Release date - Jan 30, 2015_

  * Enhancement: Physically motivated temperature cutoff for photo-
	electric heating added.
  * Bugfix: Spatially constant photo-electric heating now included in
	purely tabulated cooling mode.
  * Bugfix: Make sure grackle_data_file string is null-terminated.
  * Minor compilation bugfixes.
  * Installation docs updated.

== Version 2.0 ==
_Release date - Oct 1, 2014_

  * Enhancement: All C++ files converted to C for easier integration into
	C and Fortran code
  * Enhancement: Main chemistry data structure moved into grackle
	namespace.  The user is no longer responsible for carrying it.
  * Enhancement: Changeable integer precision compile flag removed for
	greater simplicity
  * Enhancement: Internal chemistry and cooling calculation now always
	done in double precision with gr_float type only used for baryon
	fields.  The Grackle can now be reliably run in 32-bit mode.
  * Enhancement: Changeable Fortran baryon field precision now controlled
	with a custom variable type for better stability
  * Enhancement: Examples now available for C, C++, and Fortran codes
  * Enhancement: Grackle output now configurable so that all processors do
	not have to print info
  * Enhancement: Version and compile options now written to a file at run
	start-up

== Version 1.1 ==
_Release date - Oct 1, 2014_

  * New feature: Static library build option
  * Enhancement: Updated H-, H2, and HD chemistry and cooling rates
  * Enhancement: Sign of returned cooling time is now preserved
