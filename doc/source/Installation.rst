Installation
============

The compilation process for grackle is very similar to that for 
`Enzo <http://enzo-project.org>`_.  For more details on the Enzo build 
system, see the `Enzo build documentation 
<https://enzo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/building_enzo.html>`_.  
Compile settings for different systems are stored in files starting with 
"Make.mach" in the src/clib directory.
