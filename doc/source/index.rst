Welcome to grackle's documentation!
===================================

Grackle is a chemistry and radiative cooling library for astrophysical 
simulations.  It is a generalized and trimmed down version of the chemistry 
network of the `Enzo <http://enzo-project.org>`_ simulation code.  It 
provides a non-equilibrium primordial chemistry network for atomic H and He 
as well as H\ :sub:`2`\  and HD; tabulated metal cooling rates calculated 
with the photo-ionization code, `Cloudy <http://nublado.org>`_; and 
photo-heating and photo-ionization from the UV backgrounds of 
`Faucher-Giguere et. al. (2009) 
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...703.1416F>`_ and 
`Haardt & Madau (2012) 
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...746..125H>`_.
